# Password Generator

This project involves generating a randomized password for the user. The program asks the user if they want to include uppercase, lowercase, number & special characters in their password.
then it asks how long the user wants the password to be (between 8-12) and then randomly generates the desired password for the user.

## To-do list

* Allow for the user to stop pass generation if they hit cancel on the length prompt
* add gif of working project (show the errors along the way)

# Possible improvements

* Copy button that shows up next to the generate password after it's been made which copies to clipboard on click
