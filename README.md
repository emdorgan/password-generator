# Password Generator

This project generates a randomized password for the user. The program asks the user if they want to include uppercase, lowercase, number and/or special characters in their password.
then it asks how long the user wants the password to be (between 8-12) and then randomly generates the password for the user with the desired parameters. The user also has the option to cancel the password generation at any time.

# Possible improvements

* Copy button that shows up next to the generate password after it's been made which copies to clipboard on click
