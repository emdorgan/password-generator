# Password Generator

This project involves generating a randomized password for the user. The program prompts the user for a character length (between 8 and 125) and outputs a randomized password of the desired length.

## To-do list

* Generate random password
* make the cancel button on user prompt not error out

# Possible improvements

* Copy button that shows up next to the generate password after it's been made which copies to clipboard on click
